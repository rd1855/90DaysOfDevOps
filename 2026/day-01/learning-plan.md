# 90 Days of DevOps – Personal Learning Plan

## About Me
- **Name:** Rohit Desai  
- **Current Level:** Fresher (IT background, aspiring Cloud & DevOps Engineer)  
- **Start Date:** Day 01 of #90DaysOfDevOps  

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that bridge the gap between development and operations by enabling faster, reliable, and automated software delivery.  
Cloud provides on-demand infrastructure and services that allow applications to scale, remain highly available, and reduce operational overhead.

Together, DevOps and Cloud focus on automation, monitoring, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
- I want to build **real-world engineering skills**, not just theoretical knowledge.
- DevOps aligns with my interest in **Linux, automation, cloud platforms, and CI/CD**.
- I aim to become a **job-ready DevOps Engineer** with hands-on project experience.
- I want a career that values **problem-solving, ownership, and continuous learning**.

## Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Goals)
By the end of 90 days, I aim to:
1. Deploy a **production-like application** on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes.
2. Build and run **end-to-end CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
3. Be confident in **Linux, Git, Cloud basics, and DevOps troubleshooting**, enough to crack entry-level DevOps roles.

## Core DevOps Skills I Will Build
1. **Linux & Git Fundamentals** – system usage, debugging, version control.
2. **CI/CD & Automation** – pipelines, builds, testing, deployments.
3. **Cloud & Containers** – AWS basics, Docker, Kubernetes fundamentals.

## Time Commitment & Consistency Plan
- **Weekdays:** 2–2.5 hours per day  
- **Weekends:** 4–6 hours per day  
- **Weekly Average:** ~18–20 hours  

### How I Will Stay Consistent
- Study at a **fixed daily time slot**.
- Focus on **hands-on practice over passive watching**.
- Maintain notes and code on GitHub.
- Learn in public by sharing progress weekly on LinkedIn.
- Even on low-energy days, do **at least 30 minutes** to maintain momentum.

## My Commitment
I understand that DevOps is a long-term journey.  
For the next 90 days, I commit to showing up daily, staying disciplined, and focusing on execution over perfection.

Consistency > Motivation.
